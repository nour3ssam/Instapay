## Overview
This project is a Card Management System implemented in C++ utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system allows users to register, log 
 in, manage their Visa and MasterCard accounts, and perform transactions such as sending and receiving money. I tried to use some of the topics of OOP:
1. Classes and Objects.
2. Encapsulation.
3. Inheritance.
3. Polymorphism.
5. Abstraction.
6. Constructor.


## How to Use
#### Main Menu
1. Login: Enter your username and password to log in.
2. Sign Up: Create a new user account by providing a username, password, and phone number.
3. Exit: Exit the program.
##### After logging in, you will have several options: 
1. Send Money: Choose to send money either by username or phone number.
2. Show Money: View the balance of your Visa or MasterCard.
3. Add Visa: Add a new Visa or MasterCard to your account.
4. Add Money: Deposit money into your Visa or MasterCard account.
5. Main Menu: Return to the main menu.
6. Exit: Exit the program.
